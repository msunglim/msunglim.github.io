    <h1>Hello I am Moungsung Im and major Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology.</h1>
    
    <h2>Basic info</h2>
    
    <p>This website is made to exhibit my personal programming projects and get to know HTML.</p>
    
    <h2>Notification</h2>
    
    <p>Since every Korean man has to go to military for one and half year <br>
I just create this website for few months and develop it later when I come back for break <br>
Please pray for me :) <br>
미필이라 좋은 인생이었다~</p>
